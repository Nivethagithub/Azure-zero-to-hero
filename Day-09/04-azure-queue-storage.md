# Azure Queue Storage

1. What is it?

    Azure Queue Storage is a message queue service that allows decoupling of components in a distributed application.
    It provides a reliable way to store and retrieve messages between application components, ensuring asynchronous communication.

2. üîó What is Decoupling?
Decoupling means designing systems where components are independent of each other, so changes or failures in one part don‚Äôt break the whole system.

## üîÅ Example:
**Let‚Äôs say:**
* You have a front-end app for taking customer orders.
* You have a backend app for processing those orders.

If the backend is slow or temporarily down, the frontend can still work by placing the order in a queue. The backend will process it when it‚Äôs back up.

**üéØ Benefit:**
Systems become more scalable, fault-tolerant, and easier to maintain.

3. When to use it?

    Use Azure Queue Storage when you need to enable communication and coordination between different parts of a distributed application.
    It is suitable for scenarios like handling background jobs, managing tasks asynchronously, and facilitating communication between loosely coupled components.

4. Example from DevOps Engineer point of view?

    A DevOps engineer may use Azure Queue Storage to implement a message queue for processing background tasks or managing communication between microservices.
    During deployment, scripts can enqueue messages to trigger specific actions or coordinate tasks between different components.

5. Equivalent service in AWS:

    The equivalent service in AWS is Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS). SQS provides a fully managed message queue service for decoupling components in a distributed system.
