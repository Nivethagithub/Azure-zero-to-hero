# Types of Virtual Machines on Azure

Azure provides a variety of virtual machine (VM) offerings to cater to different workload requirements. Each VM type is designed with specific hardware configurations to meet diverse performance and scalability needs.

## General Purpose VMs

1. Standard_D2s_v3 -  General Purpose VMs (Hosting websites, lightweight applications)
2. Standard_F2s_v2 -  Compute Optimized VMs (Batch processing, gaming applications)
3. Standard_E16s_v3 - Memory Optimized VMs (Running large databases)
4. Standard_L8s_v2  - Storage Optimized VMs (Big data applications, data warehousing)
5. Standard_NC6s_v3 -  GPU VMs (ML, graphics rendering)
6. Standard_H16r   -  High-Performance Compute VMs (Simulations, modeling)  
7. B1s             -  Burstable VMs   (small websites)

**Example: Standard_D2s_v3**

- **Description:** General-purpose VMs are well-balanced machines suitable for a variety of workloads. They offer a good balance of CPU-to-memory ratio and are suitable for development, testing, and small to medium-sized databases.

- **Use Case:** Hosting websites, lightweight applications, or development and testing environments.

## Compute Optimized VMs

**Example: Standard_F2s_v2**

- **Description:** Compute optimized VMs are designed for **compute-intensive workloads that require high CPU power**. They provide a high CPU-to-memory ratio, making them suitable for data analytics and computational tasks.

- **Use Case:** Batch processing, gaming applications, and other CPU-intensive workloads.

## Memory Optimized VMs

**Example: Standard_E16s_v3**

- **Description:** Memory optimized VMs are tailored for memory-intensive applications. They provide a high memory-to-CPU ratio, making them suitable for databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.

- **Use Case:** Running large databases, in-memory caching, and analytics applications.

## Storage Optimized VMs

**Example: Standard_L8s_v2**

- **Description:** Storage optimized VMs are designed for workloads that require high storage throughput and I/O performance. They provide high local disk throughput, making them suitable for big data and large databases.

- **Use Case:** Big data applications, data warehousing, and large-scale databases.

## GPU VMs

**Example: Standard_NC6s_v3**

- **Description:** GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) VMs are equipped with powerful graphics processors, suitable for graphics-intensive applications and parallel processing tasks.

- **Use Case:** Machine learning, graphics rendering, and simulations that require GPU acceleration.

## High-Performance Compute VMs

**Example: Standard_H16r**

- **Description:** High-Performance Compute VMs are designed for demanding, parallel processing and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

- **Use Case:** Simulations, modeling, and scenarios that require massive parallel processing.

## Burstable VMs

**Example: B1s**

- **Description:** Burstable VMs provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline for a certain period. They are cost-effective for workloads with varying CPU usage.

- **Use Case:** Development and testing environments,  , and applications with variable workloads.
